PETFUL

APP by Matt Dizzle Rougely

## Summary

Petful is a site for an animal shelter which allows adoption of cats and dogs. These are the only 2 animals allowed in the shelter. The adoption process works strictly on a "First-In, First-Out" basis. The FIFO is based on the animals that came to the shelter first. People can adopt a cat, or a dog, or both, but they may only adopt the animal that came to the shelter first is the one to be adopted first. In addition, people who want to adopt are also put in a Queue so they can adopt when its their turn. If the animal has been adopted by someone else, you are unable to adopt this animal and have to wait your turn.
